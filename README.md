# Full Stack Engineer
A #fullstackengineer writes specs and designs software, besides just coding.

They work with business requirements specifications (#br-spec) documents which should explain *what* is needed and *why* is needed. These documents should contain scenarios, including wireframes, written in a precise and concise manner. From looking at it any engineer should be able to accurately commit to a delivery date and a required compensation as part of a Software Engineering Bid.

I consider fullstack engineers and software engineering bids one of the best combinations (as of April 2024) to deliver software in a #freemarketplace.

The objective of this project is to show openly and publicly this paradigm with examples so that I can easily share with future engineers that work with me how I like to build software.

The br-spec document contains an example of a business requested functionality.

The e2e-spec document contains an example of end to end specifications for a different business requested functionality.

The Playwright ts file contains the implementation of the e2e-spec.

The job of a fullstack engineer working with me in my projects is to deliver:

1. An e2e-spec out of the br-spec provided.
1. A dp-spec out of the e2e-spec.
1. An automated e2e test (Playwright, Testcafe, Selenium, etc).
1. Backend API code.
1. Frontend code.
